## Plate Boundaries

The regions of highest strain rate at the surface of the Earth are the plate boundaries.

The styles and patterns of deformation are very dependent on the orientation of the stresses that are acting at the boundary which is not recorded in this map.

This map includes diagrams of the physical processes that are happening at the smaller scale at each type of plate boundary.

The "definitive" map of the plate boundaries is the one from Peter Bird (2003) which identifies (and digitises) the plate boundary segments and categorises them. It even continues into the continental regions where plate boundaries are questionable at best.

## Continental v. Oceanic Plate Boundaries

This is a close-up of the strain rate in the Himalayas -- a collision zone which we can also think of as a convergent plate boundary that has been entirely congested by continental crust.

In continental regions, the processes that are responsible for creating the distinct types of plate boundaries in the oceans are masked because of the thick, buoyant crust that makes up a significant fraction of the lithosphere.
