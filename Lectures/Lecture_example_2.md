# Lecture 2 - Slides 


This is an embedded slide show that will show you a few tricks. 

<iframe src="../slideshows/example_slide_deck2.reveal.html" title="Slideshow" width=100%, height=500, allowfullscreen></iframe>


The embedding is via an `html iframe` that points to the built path (all the slides are rendered into the 
slideshows directory at the `root` level of the book)

```html
<iframe src="../slideshows/example_slide_deck2.reveal.html" title="Slideshow" width=100%, height=500, allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

## Source

This is the source code for the slide deck. It is mostly (reveal-md) markdown with 1) a `yaml` header that has reveal options in it, 2) html tags that use `reveal.js` styling. Note that it is relatively easy to make a few slides this way but more than this can become complicated.

`````markdown
---
title: Example 1
# separator: <!--s-->
# verticalSeparator: <!--v-->
theme: white
revealOptions:
#    transition: 'fade'
    slideNumber: true
    width: 1600
    height: 900

## Slide 2

Typically, we have one or two images on a slide 

<img class="r-stretch" data-src="images/LithosphereThickness.png">

and text that explains what is going on. 
The markdown image tags are limiting but `reveal.js` has image
classes that can be used directly without too much bother:

```html
<img class="r-stretch" data-src="images/LithosphereThickness.png">
```

## Slide 3

Animations / styling work using `reveal.js` classes 

<p class="fragment">Fade in</p>
<p class="fragment fade-out">Fade out</p>
<p class="fragment highlight-red">Highlight red</p>
<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">Fade in, then out</p>
<p class="fragment fade-up">Slide up while fading in</p>
