# Lecture notes for example course

Two examples of lecture notes and simple slideshows that we can embed.

The lecture notes are in standard `myst markdown` format like the rest of the book.

The slideshows are built along with the book using `reveal-md`. They are supposed to 
be very simple, versionable (text based, not binaries) and rely on external links for
complicated media such as large movies. 

[Lecture 1](Lecture_example_1) is a demonstration

[Lecture 2](Lecture_example_2) has a bit of information about the `reveal-md` slides
