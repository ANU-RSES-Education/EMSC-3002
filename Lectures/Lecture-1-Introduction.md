## Overview 

The material in the course is split into five modules that cover:
  - Global Tectonics
  - Structures in the Earch
  - Theoretical background
  - Brittle Deformation
  - Ductile Deformation

There are links to helpful external sites and background reading that you can find on pages for each module here and on wattle. All assessment is via wattle.

### Remote Participation
  We will make all the lectures available via zoom. In-person attendance is always preferable though restrictions on numbers may apply.

### Summary of Course Assessment

There will be 5 short quizzes during the semester that will help you to calibrate your knowledge from the course material for each module and which you can use for revision. The first of these quizzes will be a refresher on plate tectonics which you will be allowed to re-take after an optional tutorial. (20% on these quizzes)

Lab-based assessments will be worth 20% of the course in total. One assessment will be an exercise on interpreting sandbox models that you will be running in the lab. The second will be a mapping exercise.

There will be a poster presentation and final report that together make up 20% of the course assessment.

The final exam will be worth 40% of the course.

*We are, of course, open to some negotiation of the weight of the assessment tasks and their timing where this helps to cement the learning goals.*
