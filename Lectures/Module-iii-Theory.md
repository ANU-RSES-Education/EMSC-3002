# Theoretical Underpinnings

This section of the course covers the theoretical background of structural geology and tectonics that we need to go deeper in our understanding of how structures form and how to analyse their geometry.

## Lecture Slides

The slides are originally made using PowerPoint and then convert to html / javascript format through stacking a series of snapshots. If you would like to download a pdf version, the link provided will process the files and you can then *print from your browser* to a file (or paper copy if that is what you prefer). A pdf version of the original format is provided in the Wattle to have three slides each page on the left with space for notes on the right. 

### Stress

The first part of this module introduces the concept of stress, stress tensor xxx.
