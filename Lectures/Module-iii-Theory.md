# Theoretical Underpinnings

This section of the course covers the theoretical background of structural geology and tectonics that we need to go deeper in our understanding of how structures form and how to analyse their geometry.

## Lecture Slides

The slides are originally made using PowerPoint and then convert to html / javascript format through stacking a series of snapshots. Therefore it does not work well if printing them from your browser. But a pdf version of the original format is provided in the Wattle to have three slides each page on the left with space for notes on the right. 

### Stress

The first part of this module introduces the concept of stress, stress tensor, the derivation and application of Mohr circle and the methods to measure stress inside the Earth.

### Strain and Strain Rate

The next part of the module covers the topic of strain and strain rate, their tensor expression and introduces the strain classification and general methods for strain analysis.

### Rheology

The last part of the module explores the relationship between stress and strain, i.e. the rheological property of rock materials.
