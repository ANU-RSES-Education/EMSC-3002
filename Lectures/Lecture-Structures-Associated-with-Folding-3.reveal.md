### Lineations

A *lineation* is a fabric element in which one dimension is significantly larger than the other two.

- Very common in Metamorphic Rocks
- Closely associated with strain and transport or shear direction and in
such useful to determine paleostresses orientations and kinematics.

Different types of lineations, different origins and implications for the history of deformation

<--o-->

#### Primary or non-tectonic lineations

Can occur in both deformed and non-deformed rocks.

examples:

- Flow lineations and columns in basalts and magmatic rocks.
- Alignements of non spherical pebbles, fossils etc.

<--o-->

#### Tectonic lineations

Linear structures resulting from the deformation of a rock under tectonic stresses.

- **Penetrative lineation**: build-up a linear fabric or **L-Fabric**
- **Surface lineation**: Restricted to a surface (e.g. *Slikenslides*)
- **Geometric lineation**: fold axes, intersection lineations

<--o-->

##### Lineations related to plastic deformation

**Penetrative lineations** are typically found in rocks that deformed in the plastic regime.

- **L-Tectonites**: Lineations form the dominant fabric (X>>Y>>Z)
- **LS-Tectonites**: Combination of foliations and penetrative lineations (Very common)
- **S-Tectonites**: no or very little linear fabric.

<--o-->

##### Mineral lineations

Minerals and mineral aggregates can form a linear fabric via recrystallisation, dissolution / precipitation or rigid rotation.

Cataclasis (crushing) of minerals can also lead to the formation of linerations (example in shear-zones).

<--o-->

#### Stretching lineations

**Stretching lineations**: stretching of minerals into a penetrative stretching lineation form the most common type of lineation in deformed
rocks.

Mineral can grow well-aligned fibrous elements in the direction of stretching or perpendicular to opening walls that define a
**mineral fiber lineation**

<--o-->

#### Intersection lineation

Intersection of planar structures in deformed rocks can define an **intersection lineation**.

When the first tectonic cleavage (S1) intersect the bedding (S0), the resulting lineation (L1) can
be observed on the bedding planes.

**Intersection lineations** can also results from the intersection of two tectonic foliations.

<--o-->

#### Crenulation lineation

High densities of parallel fold axis can constitue a fabric and create a **crenulation lineation**.

<--o-->

#### Boudinage

Boudins are competent rock layers that have been stretched into segments.
As they are commonly much longer in one direction, they can define a lineation.

<--o-->

#### Mullions

**Mullions** are linear deformation structures at interfaces where there is a significant viscosity contrast.

e.g. in metamorphic rocks, at the boundary between Quartzite and Phyllite or Micashist.

<--o-->

#### Pencil structures

Intersection of compaction cleavage and subsequent tectonic cleavage.

<--o-->

## Lineations in the brittle regime

Occur on fracture surfaces

There are two types of slickenlines: **striations** which are formed by abrasion and **slip fiber lineations** formed by
fibrous growth.

Hard objects and asperities can carve linear tracks known as **fault grooves**

<--o-->

## Lineations and kinematics

### Fault related kinmatics

**Slickenlines**, **striae** and other lineartions associated with faults are parallel to the direction of movement but do not
reveal the sense of shear which need to be determined via observation of other markers.

<--o-->

### Lineations and kinematic axes in the plastic regime

Lineation orientation depends on the intensity of strain.

Stretching lineations commonly indicate the direction of transport when projected onto the shear plane.

<--o-->

### Fold hinges and related type of lineations

Folds can form with axes at any angle to the transport direction and typically rotate toward this direction as strain accumulates and fold tightens.


<--o-->

### Boudinage

**Boudins** represent the counterpart to buckle folds and provide evidence of layer-parallel extension.
