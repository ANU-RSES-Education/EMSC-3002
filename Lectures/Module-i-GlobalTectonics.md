# Global Tectonics

This section of the course introduces global tectonic motions and contrasts the deformation patterns seen 
in oceanic plates v. the continental crust. We will revise plate kinematics and the relationship between
motions and deformation patterns, and then we will consider the forces at work.

## Lecture Slides 

The slides are in html / javascript format with some external links and movies. If you would like to download a pdf version, the link provided will process the files and you can then *print from your browser* to a file (or paper copy if that is what you prefer). The formatting is set up to work as a portrait page with the slide at the top of each page and space for notes below.

### The Lithosphere, and Plate Motions

The first part of this module introduces the structure of the Earth on a global scale and how plate motions relate to mantle circulation patterns. We map the near surface to see how plates, continental crust, and lithospheric thickness relate to deformation patterns and we identify where plate boundaries are and their types.

### Plate Boundaries

The next part of the module covers the nature of the plate boundaries and introduces some of the techniques we will use in this course to identify the forces that are at work.

### Stresses, Strains, Strain-rates and Strength

A brief introduction to the physical forces that are at work, definitions of stress, strain and strain rate.
The different way rocks respond to stress.

### Plate Kinematics and reconstruction

If we understand the *kinematics* of plate boundary evolution, then we can run a configuration backwards in time to observe the earlier configuration. In this short concluding part of the module, we cast the observations about plate deformation in the form of hard-and-fast rules and we see what we can do with them.



## Links

The plate reconstruction community uses a tool known as [GPlates](https://www.gplates.org) that was developed at the University of Sydney (along with many international collaborators). There is a portal where you can [browse interactive movies](http://portal.gplates.org) of plates moving over hundreds of millions of years with various data visualised on the moving plates.

## Background Reading

  - [Lecture notes by Magali Billen (UC Davis)](https://geo.libretexts.org/Courses/University_of_California_Davis/UCD_GEL_56_-_Introduction_to_Geophysics/Geophysics_is_everywhere_in_geology.../04%3A_Plate_Tectonics) on plate tectonics including plate motions and plate forces that will be a good background reference for these lectures.

  - Pamphlet on [Roof Support in Coal Mines](https://www.culturenlmuseums.co.uk/SIModes/Detail/14223) from the North Lanarkshire Museums collection which connects stress, layering and underground engineering. Not to mention a different attitude to health and safety from last century.
