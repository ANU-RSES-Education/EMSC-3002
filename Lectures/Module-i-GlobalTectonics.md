# Global Tectonics

This section of the course introduces global tectonic motions and contrasts the deformation patterns seen 
in oceanic plates v. the continental crust. We will revise plate kinematics and the relationship between
motions and deformation patterns, and then we will consider the forces at work.

## Lecture Slides 

### The Lithosphere, and Plate Motions

The first part of this module introduces the structure of the Earth on a global scale and how plate motions relate to mantle circulation patterns. We map the near surface to see how plates, continental crust, and lithospheric thickness relate to deformation patterns and we identify where plate boundaries are and their types.

### Plate Boundaries

The next part of the module covers the nature of the plate boundaries and introduces some of the techniques we will use in this course to identify the forces that are at work.

### Stresses, Strains, Strain-rates and Strength

A brief introduction to the physical forces that are at work ... that will be covered in detail in Module 3

### Plate Kinematics and reconstruction

If we understand the *kinematics* of plate boundary evolution, then we can run a configuration backwards in time to observe the earlier configuration. In this part of the module, we cast the observations about plate deformation in the form of hard-and-fast rules and we see what we can do with them.
