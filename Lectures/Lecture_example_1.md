# Lecture 1 - Notes

A lecture can have some notes and a slideshow. 

<iframe src="../slideshows/example_slide_deck1.reveal.html" title="Slideshow" width=100%, height=500, allowfullscreen></iframe>

The embedding is via an `html iframe` that points to the built path (all the slides are rendered into the 
slideshows directory at the `root` level of the book)

```html
<iframe src="../slideshows/example_slide_deck1.reveal.html" title="Slideshow" width=100%, height=500, allowfullscreen></iframe>
```
