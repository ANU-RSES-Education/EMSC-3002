## Cleavage development

**cleavage** is the low-temperature type of **foliation** and is best developed in rocks with abundant platy minerals (philosilicates)

Temperature increases with crustal depth and as it increases so is the mobility of minerals and the potential for recrystallisation.
Cleavage usually develops at temperature below $350-370C$. At higher temperature we see **Shistosity** and **Mylonite foliations**.

**Edinburg Formation in western Virginia**
Both primary bedding and secondary cleavage can be discerned in this outcrop of Edinburg Formation in western Virginia. The bedding is Ordovician is age, but the cleavage was superimposed later, during late Paleozoic mountain-building.

### Lithology

Lithology is important as different minerals react differently to temperature.

Philosilicates are important and facilitate cleavage development. 

In calcareous rocks, which are generally poor in philosilicates, cleavage is controlled by the mobility of carbonate and the development of 
stylolites.

**Keels, Newfoundland**
Stromatolites are ancient microbial mats that domed upward toward the sunlight as they grew. They were laid down in sticky layers of slime by photosynthetic microbes, probably cyanobacteria. But that’s not all we see here. The tectonic cleavage is also a prominent feature of these rocks. Here, you can see bedding marked out by the different colored layers going left-to-right across the outcrop, while cleavage is more or less vertical, and etched out by seaside weathering:

### Development of Secondary foliations: compaction cleavage

<div>

<div style="width:50%; float:left">

Non-tectonic cleavage and thus often regarded as $S_0$.

Compaction results in reorientation of mineral grains and collapse of pore space. It usually accentuate and rework the primary foliation $S_0$.

A clay or claystone will then results in a shale with **compaction cleavage**

#### Pressure solution

<div>

<div style="width:50%; float:left">
Pressure solution or Wet diffusion can occur.

Very common in carbonates where quartz or carbonates are dissolved and result in concentration of residual minerals.
This also happens in clay and claystone where the dissolution of quartz results in concentration of clay minerals.

The seams are **stylolites** and the foliation can be called a **stylolite cleavage** or a **pressure solution cleavage**.

#### Pressure solution

<div>
<div style="width:70%; float:left">

Minerals diffuse away, perpendicular to the direction of $\sigma 1$,  through a very thin film of fluid along
the grain boundaries and precipitates in pressure shadows of larger and/or more rigid grains or are simply trnsported out of the rocks.

Very significant amount of material is lost through **pressure solution**. This presents interesting consequences in terms of
thermodynamics and fluid flow though the crust.

### Development of Secondary foliations: early tectonic development


<div>
<div style="width:50%; float:left">

Rock (e.g. sedimentary rock) exposed to tectonic stress that leads to progressive shortening of sedimentary beds.

Typical of foreland regions of orogenic belts.

In limestones and sandstones, the first foliation to form is a pressure solution cleavage, typically stylolithic.

Stylolites (pressure solution seams) in limestone of Mississippian age, exposed on the side of a rounded boulder in Hyalite Canyon, Gallatin Range, Montana. These stylolites, like most, are bedding-parallel, and thus most likely formed due to the weight of the overlying rock. Calcite, the dominant mineral, goes into solution under pressure, and insoluble material, like organic matter and clay, accumulates along the dissolution surface, producing a dark, wiggly line. Here, multiple stylolites have converged and overprinted one another, resulting in a mutli-level “oscilloscope” look.

### Development of Secondary foliations: early tectonic development

If $\sigma 1$ is horizontal, this result in a $S_1$ cleavage that is at high angle with $S_0$.

<div>
<div style="width:30%; float:left">

When $S_0$ and $S_1$ are equally marked, we can obtain a **pencil cleavage**: the rock will fracture along both $S_0$ and $S_1$ along
pencil shaped fragments.

**Pencil cleavage** can also occur because of change in the regional stress field.

### Development of Secondary foliations: early tectonic development

<div>
<div style="width:50%; float:left">

If the tectonic shortening persist, $S_1$ eventually dominates the structure and texture of the rock.
We obtain a **slate**, a **slaty cleavage**.

</div>

<div style="width:50%; float:right">

![Slaty Cleavage](Figures-Structures-Associated-with-Folding-2/figures/Slaty_cleavage.svg) <!-- .element style="float: right" width="90%" -->

</div>
</div>

The metamorphism is low. We are at the very beginning of recristallisation of clay minerals. 
Cleavage forms through grain rotation, growth of minerals with a preferred direction, and most importantly
**pressure solution**  of the most solvent minerals in the rock at the microscopic scale. 

We can thus observe **domainal cleavage** with **Quartz-Feldspar (QF) Domain** and
**philosilicates (M) Domain**.

### Development of Secondary foliations: early tectonic development

Early tectonic **Domainal cleavage** are often **Disjunction cleavage** which means they
cut across than rather crenulates (folds) preexisting cleavage.

### Development of Secondary foliations: greenshist facies, from cleavage to shistosity

<div>
<div style="width:50%; float:left">

New philosilicates grow at the expense of clay minerals in shales and slates (**philitic cleavage**)

New micas grow larger (visible in hand sample) with new basal planes more or less perpendicular to the Z-axis of the strain ellipsoid and more or
less perpendicular to $\sigma 1$.

We have a more pronunced development of the **QF** and **M** domains as the wet dissolution or **pressure solution**
becomes more efficient.

Foliation is no longer a cleavage but a shistosity. The rock is a **shist**.

### Development of Secondary foliations: greenshist facies, from cleavage to shistosity


While wet diffusion (pressure solution) governs cleavage formation, crystal plastic deformation mecanisms become
more important during the formation of shistosity.

#### Secondary tectonic cleavage

A preexisting foliation can be affected by a later cleavage ($S_2$ or higher), as a result of reorientation of the
stress field for example.

<div>
<div style="width:50%; float:left">

The existing foliation is overprinted, generally via folding. We obtain a **crenulation cleavage**
A series of microfolds, <1cm with parallel axial surfaces.

</div>

<div style="width:50%; float:right">

![Crenulation Cleavage](Figures-Structures-Associated-with-Folding-2/figures/Crenulation_cleavage.svg) <!-- .element style="float: right" width="90%" -->

</div>
</div>

Depending on the angle between the existing foliation and the stress orientation, the crenulation will be symmetric or asymmetric.
