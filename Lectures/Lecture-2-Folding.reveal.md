## Resources


## Intended learning outcomes

Students will be able to:

- **Classify folds** according to fold terminology.
- Understand **Folding Mechanims**
- Find second order folds and cleavage
- Identify **folding and faulting in extensional** regimes
- Identify **folding and faulting in compressional** regimes.

## Folds, Why are they important?

Hydrocarbon industry:

- Folds and associated structures can form traps.
- Understanding folds periodicity and geometry is key for the selection of drilling sites.

Mineral Industry:

- Understanding folds structures is important in assessing the extent of ore reserves and the
viability of mines.

## Fold Morphology

The conditions of deformation usually vary both in space and time, differences in rock type,
temperature, pressure and strain-rate translates in a wide range of fold geometry or **fold styles**.

Correct interpretation of the variations in fold style is important to reconstruct the
geological history of an area.

## Geometric Aspects of folds

![Fold](Lecture-2-Folding-images/Figure_2_Geometric_Aspects_of_folds.jpg) <!-- .element style="float: right" width="60%" -->

**Folds** are usually best studied in section perpendicular to the layering, or
perpendicular to what is defined as the **axial surface**.

Folds are made up of a **hinge** that connects to **limbs**.

The **hinge** may be abrupt but usually the curvature is gradual and define a 
**hinge zone**.

## Geometric Aspects of folds

Accurate description of folded structures requires using a specific vocabulary.

Key to compare natural structures across different contexts.

## Thickness and Fold wavelength

![Fold](Lecture-2-Folding-images/Figure_17_Thickness_and_Fold_wavelengths.svg) <!-- .element style="float: right" width="50%" -->

Different layer thicknesses and/or rheologies produce different wavelengths of folds.

The geometry of the 2nd and 3rd order of folds show where the large structures are!
