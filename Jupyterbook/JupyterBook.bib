	abstract = {Understanding rock deformation processes in solid Earth materials, from the crystal to the tectonic plate scale, is essential for characterising the evolution of the lithosphere and for predicting how rocks behave in the subsurface. Temperature is a key parameter that determines what rock deformation processes are active and therefore how tectonic structures form. Moreover, it controls the migration of fluids and melt in the Earth’s crust that lead to phase transformations and changes in rock rheology. This special issue gathers a collection of research papers following the 21st International Conference on Deformation Mechanisms, Rheology and Tectonics (DRT-2017), which was held in Inverness (Scotland) in April–May 2017, organised by the University of Aberdeen. These contributions provide a significant advance in the study of rock deformation and fluid/melt migration at multiple crustal levels, from deformation bands near the Earth’s surface to shear zones in partially molten rocks in the lower crust. In this introductory article, we first provide an overview of how temperature controls deformation mechanisms and processes and then introduce the collection of research papers ordered from those analysing deformation processes occurring at high temperatures to contributions reporting deformation at shallow crustal conditions.},

	abstract = {Rupture‐zone averaged static stress drop in the 2011 M=9 Tohoku‐Oki earthquake was less than 5 MPa, but it caused a stress reversal in most of the offshore forearc, although the reversal is less well constrained far offshore by earthquake mechanisms because of 20‐ to 30‐km errors in event depths. Using a ﬁnite element model of force balance, we demonstrate that the stress reversal unambiguously indicates (1) a very weak subduction megathrust and (2) very low differential stresses in the forearc. Prior to the reversal, the upper limit of megathrust strength could not be determined from forearc stresses. In the forearc, effects of megathrust friction and gravity are in a fragile balance, and stresses ﬂuctuate around a neutral state in earthquake cycles. If most of the offshore forearc is to be compressive before but extensional after the earthquake, the effective friction coefﬁcient of the megathrust must be {\textasciitilde}0.032. Under low differential stresses associated with megathrust weakness, the forearc is generally well below yielding. Applying the concepts of dynamic Coulomb wedge, we show that the inner wedge, and by inference farther landward, stays stable throughout earthquake cycles. The outer wedge is stable most of the time but may occasionally enter a critical state during great earthquakes; its geometry suggests that complete stress drop of the underlying shallow megathrust is unlikely to have happened. We reason that the occurrence of earthquakes and active faulting under low stress in the stable forearc is due to heterogeneities in structure, stress, and/or pore ﬂuid pressure.},

	abstract = {In nature, subducting slabs and overriding plate segments bordering subduction zones are generally embedded within larger plates. Such large plates can impose far-ﬁeld boundary conditions that inﬂuence the style of subduction and overriding plate deformation. Here we present dynamic laboratory models of progressive subduction in three-dimensional space, in which the far-ﬁeld boundary conditions at the trailing edges of the subducting plate (SP) and overriding plate (OP) are varied. Four conﬁgurations are presented: Free (both plates free), SP-Fixed, OP-Fixed, and SP-OP-Fixed. We investigate their impact on the kinematics and dynamics of subduction, particularly focusing on overriding plate deformation. The results indicate that the variation in far-ﬁeld boundary conditions has an inﬂuence on the slab geometry, subduction partitioning, and trench migration partitioning. Our models also indicate that in natural (narrow) subduction zones, assuming a homogeneous overriding plate, the formation of back-arc basins (e.g., Tyrrhenian Sea, Aegean Sea, and Scotia Sea) is generally expected to occur at a comparable location (250–700 km from the trench), irrespective of the boundary condition. In addition, our models indicate that the style of fore-arc deformation (shortening or extension) is inﬂuenced by the mobility of the overriding plate through controlling the force normal to the subduction zone interface (trench suction). Our geodynamic model that uses the SP-OP-Fixed setup is comparable to the Calabria subduction zone with respect to subduction kinematics, slab geometry, trench curvature, and accretionary conﬁguration. Furthermore, the model can explain back-arc and fore-arc extension at the Calabria subduction zone since the latest middle Miocene as a consequence of subduction of the narrow Calabrian slab and the immobility of the subducting African plate and overriding Eurasian plate. This setting induced strong trench suction, driving forearc extension, and forced subduction to be accommodated almost entirely by slab rollback (not trenchward subducting plate motion), while trench retreat was accommodated almost entirely by back-arc and fore-arc extension (not trenchward overriding plate motion), comparable to our SP-OP-Fixed model.},

Here, by incorporating century‐long leveling data and contemporary global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) velocities, we investigate the temporal evolution of interseismic deformation in southwest Japan using two‐dimensional viscoelastic earthquake‐cycle models. We ﬁnd that a steady‐state continental mantle viscosity of 1019 Pa·s is required to explain these two geodetic data sets. Our preferred model predicts signiﬁcant variations in the surface velocity ﬁeld throughout the entire interseismic period due to viscous mantle ﬂow driven by ongoing megathrust locking, indicating that the multiyear GNSS‐derived velocity ﬁeld represents a snapshot of time‐varying interseismic deformation. The locking depth and locking time exert signiﬁcant inﬂuences on the horizontal and vertical deformation patterns. Our ﬁndings highlight the importance of the interseismically relaxing mantle and the necessity of considering such an effect in determining the current locking state along the Nankai subduction zone. Plain Language Summary Interseismic viscoelastic relaxation due to megathrust fault locking is explored recently using a viscoelastic Earth model for the late‐stage interseismic period in the Cascadia and Peru‐North Chile subduction zones, where the last great earthquake occurred centuries ago, and the next event is expected in the near future. In southwest Japan, the last great earthquake occurred only several decades ago, providing a unique opportunity to study the viscoelastic relaxation in early‐stage interseismic period. We use historical measurements of uplift rates that were acquired before and after the last great earthquake and modern geodetic measurements of the horizontal and vertical surface velocities to constrain our numerical models and investigate how and why the surface deformation varies throughout the long interseismic period. We ﬁnd that the horizontal and vertical velocity ﬁeld gradually evolves into a long‐wavelength pattern and a rather ﬂat pattern, respectively, before the next event, which is consistent with both the historical and recent observations. Therefore, the recent and short time geodetic measurements in southwest Japan represent a snapshot of the time‐variable signal because the weak Earth mantle is ﬂowing viscously, driven by persistent megathrust fault locking, and the ﬂow has not achieved a steady state.},

	abstract = {In Northeast Japan, it remains a puzzle to reconcile the mismatch between long-term (geological) uplift and lateinterseismic and coseismic subsidence associated with the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. To explain this mismatch between different periods, we modeled the entire megathrust earthquake cycle in the Northeast Japan arc using a simple dislocation model with a two-layered lithosphere–asthenosphere structure in which we account for viscoelastic relaxation in the asthenosphere and tectonic erosion. The model behaves differently when the rupture stops within the lithosphere and when it cuts through the lithosphere to reach the asthenosphere. It is possible to explain the mismatch in the case where the rupture stops within the lithosphere. In the early interseismic stage, the viscoelastic response to the megathrust earthquake dominates and can compensate for late-interseismic and coseismic subsidence. In contrast, the late-interseismic stage is dominated by the locking effect with the steady slip below the rupture area. Tectonic erosion explains up to about half of the long-term uplift by landward movement of arc topography. The rest of the long-term uplift may be attributed to indirect effects of internal deformation in the arc.},

	abstract = {Recent megathrust events in Tohoku (Japan), Maule (Chile), and Sumatra (Indonesia) were well recorded. Much has been learned about the dominant physical processes in megathrust zones: (partial) locking of the plate interface, detailed coseismic slip, relocking, afterslip, viscoelastic mantle relaxation, and interseismic loading. These and older observations show complex spatial and temporal patterns in crustal deformation and displacement, and signiﬁcant differences among different margins. A key question is whether these differences reﬂect variations in the underlying processes, like differences in locking, or the margin geometry, or whether they are a consequence of the stage in the earthquake cycle of the margin. Quantitative models can connect these plate boundary processes to surﬁcial and far-ﬁeld observations. We use relatively simple, cyclic geodynamic models to isolate the ﬁrst-order geodetic signature of the megathrust cycle. Coseismic and subsequent slip on the subduction interface is dynamically (and consistently) driven. A review of global preseismic, coseismic, and postseismic geodetic observations, and of their ﬁt to the model predictions, indicates that similar physical processes are active at different margins. Most of the observed variability between the individual margins appears to be controlled by their different stages in the earthquake cycle. The modeling results also provide a possible explanation for observations of tensile faulting aftershocks and tensile cracking of the overriding plate, which are puzzling in the context of convergence/compression. From the inversion of our synthetic GNSS velocities we ﬁnd that geodetic observations may incorrectly suggest weak locking of some margins, for example, the west Aleutian margin.},

These data are then used to map the stress state in the lithosphere of the downgoing plate as it bends into the subduction zone. Our results provide new constraints on the faulting of oceanic lithosphere at the outer rise, which is important for understanding the transmission of platedriving forces through the subduction system. In all cases, shallow normal-faulting earthquakes are observed at the top of the plate, and are separated in depth from any deeper thrust-faulting earthquakes. No temporal variation associated with large thrust-faulting earthquakes on the subduction interface is seen in the depth extent of each type of faulting at the outer rise. The transition depth from trench-normal extension to compression is found to vary in agreement with models in which deformation is driven by the combination of in-plane stresses and bending stresses, resulting principally from slab pull. Combining the seismologically derived constraints on the thickness of the elastic core of the plate with estimates of the plate curvature, we place upper bounds on the strength of the lithosphere at the outer rise, which is required to be 300 MPa for a constant yield stress model, or governed by an effective coefﬁcient of friction of 0.3.},

	abstract = {Rupture‐zone averaged static stress drop in the 2011 M=9 Tohoku‐Oki earthquake was less than 5 MPa, but it caused a stress reversal in most of the offshore forearc, although the reversal is less well constrained far offshore by earthquake mechanisms because of 20‐ to 30‐km errors in event depths. Using a ﬁnite element model of force balance, we demonstrate that the stress reversal unambiguously indicates (1) a very weak subduction megathrust and (2) very low differential stresses in the forearc. Prior to the reversal, the upper limit of megathrust strength could not be determined from forearc stresses. In the forearc, effects of megathrust friction and gravity are in a fragile balance, and stresses ﬂuctuate around a neutral state in earthquake cycles. If most of the offshore forearc is to be compressive before but extensional after the earthquake, the effective friction coefﬁcient of the megathrust must be {\textasciitilde}0.032. Under low differential stresses associated with megathrust weakness, the forearc is generally well below yielding. Applying the concepts of dynamic Coulomb wedge, we show that the inner wedge, and by inference farther landward, stays stable throughout earthquake cycles. The outer wedge is stable most of the time but may occasionally enter a critical state during great earthquakes; its geometry suggests that complete stress drop of the underlying shallow megathrust is unlikely to have happened. We reason that the occurrence of earthquakes and active faulting under low stress in the stable forearc is due to heterogeneities in structure, stress, and/or pore ﬂuid pressure.},

	doi = {10/bmzcmt},
	abstract = {Plane indentation experiments on unilaterally confined blocks of plasticine help us to understand finite intracontinental deformation and the evolution of strike-slip faulting in eastern Asia. Several large left-lateral strike-slip faults may have been activated successively, essentially one at a time. The experiments suggest that the penetration of India into Asia has rotated (=25°) and extruded (=800 km) Indochina to the southeast along the then left-lateral Red River fault in the first 20 to 30 m.y. of the collision. This process can account for the opening of the South China Sea before late Miocene time. Extrusion tectonics then migrated north, activating the Altyn Tagh fault as a second major left-lateral fault and moving southern China hundreds of kilometres to the east. As this occurred, Indochina kept rotating clockwise (as much as 40°), but the sense of motion reversed on the Red River and other strike-slip faults in the south. Opening of the Mergui basin and Andaman Sea (up to the present) also appears to be a simple kinematic consequence of the extrusion. Recent rifts in northeastern China and Yunnan may be considered incipient analogs of the South China and Andaman Seas. Other Tertiary tectonic features such as the sedimentary basins of the Gulf of Thailand may be explained as collisional effects, if one uses our experiments as a guide. The experiments also suggest that a major left-lateral strike-slip fault and rift system will propagate across the Tien Shan, Mongolia, and Baikal to the Sea of Okhotsk.},

	abstract = {The formation of mountain belts or rift zones is commonly attributed to interactions between plates along their boundaries, but the widely distributed deformation of Asia from Himalaya to the Japan Sea and other back-arc basins is difﬁcult to reconcile with this notion. Through comparison of the tectonic and kinematic records of the last 50 Ma with seismic tomography and anisotropy models, we show that the closure of the former Tethys Ocean and the extensional deformation of East Asia can be best explained if the asthenospheric mantle transporting India northward, forming the Himalaya and the Tibetan Plateau, reaches East Asia where it overrides the westward ﬂowing Paciﬁc mantle and contributes to subduction dynamics, distributing extensional deformation over a 3,000-km wide region. This deep asthenospheric ﬂow partly controls the compressional stresses transmitted through the continent-continent collision, driving crustal thickening below the Himalayas and Tibet and the propagation of strike-slip faults across Asian lithosphere further north and east, as well as with the lithospheric and crustal ﬂow powered by slab retreat east of the collision zone below East and SE Asia. The main shortening direction in the deforming continent between the collision zone and the Paciﬁc subduction zones may in this case be a proxy for the direction of ﬂow in the asthenosphere underneath, which may become a useful tool for studying mantle ﬂow in the distant past. Our model of the India-Asia collision emphasizes the role of asthenospheric ﬂow underneath continents and may offer alternative ways of understanding tectonic processes.},

The overall deformation in the zone is described by the deformation gradient tensor L, which may be split into a symmetric part, S,and an antisymmetric part, A. S is the strain tensor, and can always be determined from the sum of the moment tensors, following the result of Kostrov (1974). A corresponds to a rigid body rotation, and is in principle unobservable seismically: the moment tensors contain no information about A, regardless of whether the ambiguity between fault and auxiliary planes is resolved. From S the integrated rates of motion normal and parallel to the zone boundary, as well as vertically, can be calculated. Of these, only the motion normal to the zone is specified by the motion across its boundaries. In general, S (and hence L) is not specified by the motion of the plates bounding the zone. Only if some a priori assumptions about L are made, can information about A be recovered from the seismic moment tensors. Otherwise A must be determined independently from paleomagnetic or geodetic measurements.},
