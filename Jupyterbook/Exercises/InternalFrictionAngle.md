# Exercises: design an experiment to measure internal friction angle 

## Introduction

Angle of internal friction ($\phi$) is a measure of the ability of a unit of rock or soil to withstand a shear stress. It is the angle measured between the normal force and resultant force, that is attained when failure just occurs in response to a shearing stress. As discussed in the module 3.1 of the course, this parameter ($\phi$), combined with the cohesion strength ($C$), can predict whether a material is going to facture under certain stress conditions, a relationship known as the Coulomb-Mohr facture criterion. Based on this criterion, one can derive an important formula shown blow that describes the angle of internal friction and the orientation of the fracture ($\theta$):

$$
\phi = 45&deg; - \theta/2
$$

For example, most rocks have $\phi$ values of about 30&deg;, so the angle between $\sigma_1$ and the fracture of \theta is also about 30&deg;. Thus, Andersonian normal and reverse faults (i.e., different direction of $\sigma_1$) dip at about 60&deg; and 30&deg;, respectively.	

Like many other mechanical properties of a material, this angle is also depended on the temperature, pressure, saturated conditions etc. The value of the angle of internal friction can be determined in the laboratory by the $Direct Shear Test$ or the $Triaxial Stress Test$.

In this exercise, you are going to select a common material at your hand and design an experiment to measure this angle of that material. In your own lab, this angle of internal friction can be approximated by the angle of repose: materials placed in a pile to attain a conical shape with slopes (Figure on the right). There are many materials can be used to conduct this experiment, such as sugar, salt and flour in your kitchen, or soils, sands, pebbles in your yard. You can also surprise us by being creative! 

This [website](http://www.geotechdata.info/parameter/angle-of-friction) provides reference values of this angle for some common materials so that it can be used as a benchmark of your experiment. But as mentioned earlier, many other physical conditions such as temperature, water saturation etc can largely affect this property, thus these reported values can be different from yours by a bit. 

## Assessment

For the sake of assessment, you could either choose to write a separate report for this exercise or merge the experiment description with your Sandbox Experiment report. In this report, you can describe the materials (e.g., why you choose them), the set-up of the experiment and how the measurements are made and what are the results. Discussions on how the replacement of this materials with those in your real sandbox experiment affect the deformation results will be interesting. Some discussions on the potential implication of this experiment are also encouraged.
