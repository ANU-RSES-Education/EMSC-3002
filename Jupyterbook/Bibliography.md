# Bibliography

<!-- This builds the bibliography itself when jupyter-book runs 
     However, this will be only the examples that are cited using
     the JB mechanisms (i.e. not the slides etc) 
     
     We therefore have an additional step: we have a cite-everything file that is included (quietly) at the end of this file. See CiteEveryReference.md for instructions -->

```{bibliography}
