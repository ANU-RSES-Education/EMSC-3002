# Glossary

Below are some important definitions. A useful, general glossary of geological terms is found on [opengeology.org](https://opengeology.org/textbook/glossary/)

Anticline

Anticlinorium

Antiform

Asthenosphere
    A rheological domain that is the weaker zone that lies beneath the plates and allows them to move freely
Axial Surface

Axial trace

Basin

Bending

Buckling

Craton
    a region of the Earth's crust that has experienced little or no tectonic deformation for at least a billion years. 
Crest line

Culmination

Depression

Dynamics

Dome

Elastica

Facing Direction

Fold, accordion

Fold, amplitude

Fold, assymetric

Fold, axial plane or axial surface of

Fold, axial trace of

Fold, axial trend of

Fold, axis

Fold, box

Fold, chevron

Fold, close

Fold, conical

Fold, conjugate

Fold, cylindrical

Fold, domain
    part of the fold delimited by inflexion lines. Domains with negative curvature (Upward closing) are called antiforms, domains with positive curvature (downward closing) are synforms.

Fold, polyclinal

Fold, polyharmonic

Fold, tight

Fold, upright

Fold, vertical

Fold, wavelength

Hinge line
    Lines joining the points of minimum curvature and lines joining the points of
maximum curvature.
Hinge line surface

Hinge zone

Inflexion line
    Lines joining the points of zero curvature.
Inflexion line surface

Interlimb angle

Inverted saddle

Kinematics

Lithosphere
    A rheological domain that describes the upper layer of the Earth that has the most plate-like characteristics.
Median surface

Monocline

Plate (Tectonic Plate)
    A fragment of the Earth's lithosphere that is strong and moves like a rigid block on the surface. Implicitly, plates refers to the oceanic lithosphere because the continental lithosphere is often much weaker and deformable.

Plate Boundary
    The "rigid" plates move relative to one another without deforming except for the very narrow accommodation zones at their edges which are known as the *plate boundaries*. There are three main types of plate boundaries: convergent, divergent and transform which have their own kinematic "rules" and internal structure. 

Plate Boundary (Convergent)

Plate Boundary (Divergent)

Plate Boundary (Transform)

Rheology

Saddle

Strain / Strain-rate

Stress

Syncline

Synclinorium

Synform
