## Structural Geology and Crustal deformation

**What is it about?**

Structural geology covers deformation structures formed in the Earth's crust and in the underlying mantle in response to tectonic forces, in the cool upper part where the rocks have a tendency to fracture and in the hotter lower part where the deformation tends to be ductile.

Deformations structures can form almost instantaneously like during earthquakes or over millions of years like mountains.

## Structural Geology, Tectonics, Geodynamics...

Structural Geology, Tectonics and Geodynamics form a coherent and interdependent ensemble of sub-disciplines, the aim of which is the search for knowledge about how minerals, rocks and rock formations, and Earth systems (i.e., crust, lithosphere, asthenosphere ...) deform and via which processes.

**Structural Geology** is about **structures** 

**Tectonics** aims at unraveling the geological context in which deformation occurs. It involves integration of
structural geology information (maps, cross section, measurements etc.) and other disciplines (e.g. sedimentology,
geochemistry, geophysics, geochronology etc.). It typically operates at scales ranging from 100m to 1000km.
It focuses on processes such as **continental rifting**, **subduction**, **collision** etc.

**Geodynamics** focuses on the forces that drives mantle convection, plate tectonics and the deformation of Earth's material.
Geodynamics is interested in deep mantle and lithospheric processes and their link to plate motion and deformation.
Geodynamics operates on scales greater than 100km.

*Combining analog "sandbox" experiments with numerical geodynamic modeling we find that inherited rift structures explain the dramatic change in rift style from deep, narrow rift basins north and south of the Turkana area to wide, distributed deformation within the Turkana depression. The failed Cretaceous rift is also responsible for the eastward bend of the Ethiopian rift and the westward bend of the Kenyan rift when entering the Turkana depression, which generated the characteristic hook-shaped form of present-day Lake Turkana.*

Reconstructing the 3D architecture requires lots of structural measurements.

Structural geologists measure **strikes**, **dip**, **dip direction** of planar features (beeding, cleavage, fault, fold axial surface...),
and **plunge**, **plunge direction** of linear features (fold axes, lineations...)

When possible, structural geologist can determine the **magnitude** of **strain**, the **stress** orientations.
They can also determine the **kinematics**, sense of displacement along faults and shear zones.

**Cross-cutting relationships** are used determine the sequence of geological events.

Information about structures at depth can be gathered *directly* via **drilling** and *indirectly* via geophysical
method such as gravimetry annd seismic surveys.

Gravimetry gives information about the distribution of **densities** whereas seismology reveal variation in **elastic properties**.

Active seismic methods include seismic refraction and reflection and involve artificially induces elastic waves (explosive, air canon, vibration truck).
Passive seimic uses earthquakes to image the structures and interfaces at depth (e.g., Moho).

## Who needs Structural Geology?

**Hydrocarbon and Mineral exploration**

Structures control the migration, trapping and escape of hydrocarbon fluids. Structural geology is the first stage to any regional geophysical and geochemical surveys aiming at identifying new mineralized provinces. It is also critical for the interpretation of geophysical, geochemical, and geochronological data. At the mine camp scale, structural geology guide the mining process.

## Who needs Structural Geology?

**Geotechnique**

Structural geology is at the core of geotechnical site assessment for bridges, dams, tunnels, nuclear reactors, waste disposals etc. Because of the obvious relationship between faults and earthquake, structural geology is that core of earthquake prevention and earthquake seismology.

**Research**

Structural geology is central to any study of past and present mountain belts and sedimentary basins. No geological, geochemical or geophysical study can be done without the input of structural geology.

## Plate Boundaries and Morphology of the landscape

The Theory of Plate Tectonics describe how Earth's crust is broken into tectonic plates that move about the surface.
The interactions between those plates essentially occur at the boundaries. 

We typically distinguished between:
- Convergent boundaries
- Divergent boundaries
- Transform boundaries

Each of these different kind of plate boundaries produces unique features on the surface, including, faults, trenches,
volcanoes, mountains, ridges and rift valleys.

When two continental plates converge and neither of the buoyant plates is able to subduct beneath the other, this results in a collision zone.
Stress translates into vertical and horizontal displacements forming mountain ranges.

When divergent boundaries occur in continental plates, a different geological feature, called a rift valley, is formed. These depressions slowly fill with water, forming lakes, as their level drops. Ultimately, they will form the floor of a new ocean. 

*An example of this type of geological feature is the East African Rift Zone.*

**Transform boundaries** are places where plates slip horizontally past one another. At transform boundaries lithosphere is neither created nor destroyed. Many transform boundaries are found on the sea floor, where they connect segments of diverging mid-ocean ridges.
