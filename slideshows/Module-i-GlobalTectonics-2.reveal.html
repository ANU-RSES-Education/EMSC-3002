## Plate Boundaries

The regions of highest strain rate at the surface of the Earth are the plate boundaries. 

<center>

![](images/GlobalTectonics/GlobalStrainRate.png) <!-- .element style="width:66%;" -->

</center>

The styles and patterns of deformation are very dependent on the orientation of the stresses that are acting at the boundary which is not recorded in this map.

## Plate Boundary Types 

There are three categories of plate boundaries and they are clearly identifiable and distinct:

  - Divergent boundaries where the crust pulls apart and new crust is formed. 
  - Convergent boundaries where the lithosphere and oceanic crust is destroyed
  - Strike-slip boundaries where lateral motion neither creates nor destroys crust

The Earth naturally seems to separate out these different types of boundaries - at least in the oceanic lithosphere. 

**This observation is really quite remarkable, don't you agree ?**

The "definitive" map of the plate boundaries is the one from Peter Bird (2003) which identifies (and digitises) the plate boundary segments and categorises them. It even continues into the continental regions where plate boundaries are questionable at best.

The divergent boundaries largely form the global mid-ocean ridge system. This well-known map by Marie Tharp and her colleagues, identified those features as one of the most prominent geological features of the entire planet that had previously been unknown.

The morphology and bathymetry information comes to life when combined with 
the magnetic intensity maps of the mid-ocean ridge system.

Chaotic magnetic reversal patterns combined with "steady" spreading produces a symmetric stripe-pattern
that reflects the aging of the sea floor.

## Divergent Boundaries: Earthquakes

<div style="width:65%">

The focal mechanisms for earthquakes at mid-oceans ridges are indicative of normal faulting.

However, at fast spreading ridges, the high temperatures appear to suppress the normal faulting events. 

</div>

## Focal Mechanisms 1

<div style="width:50%;float:right;">

![JDF](images/GlobalTectonics/Focal_mechanism_01.jpg) 

</div>



The focal mechanism for an earthquake tells you how the ground moved during an event. For earthquakes on 
faults (and assuming that they are small enough to consider to be a point at teleseismic distance), the pattern cuts space into 4 segments defined by the fault plane and a second, orthogonally crossing plane (auxilliary plane).

When the seismic signal arrives, the first motion will either be towards or away from the source. 

*We can demonstrate that easily in a lecture room !*

## Focal Mechanisms 2

<div style="width:50%;float:right;">

![JDF](images/GlobalTectonics/Focal_mechanism_03.jpg) 

</div>

The "beachball" mechanism immediately tells you the orientation of the fault / slip although there is an ambiguity between the slip / auxilliary planes and the sense of slip. 

This is a representation of a tensor quantity known as the **moment tensor** for the event which contains information about the slip magnitude and orientation. 

Here we are assuming a double-couple mechanism (which assumes no volume change) and this is a simplification of observed moment tensors.

## Focal Mechanisms 3

<div style="width:50%;float:right;">

![JDF](images/GlobalTectonics/Focal_mechanism_02.jpg) 

</div>

We would ideally treat the focal mechanism as an unknown to be solved by predicting the waveforms of the seismic signals recorded at various instruments distributed around the event. 

Alternatively, first motions are plotted on a sterographic projection, differentiated by whether the ground moved up or down (the "first motion"), and two orthogonal great circles are drawn to separate the up and down motions into 4 quadrants. Black is used for the compressional or up quadrants.  


The beach ball is assumed to reflect the orientations of the stresses that drive the slip.  
These principal stresses are shown with the P, T, and N points, which represent three orthogonal vectors.

</center>

The cross section of a ridge showing four important factors: 
  1. The sense of movement away from the ridge axis
  1. Topography that becomes deeper away from the ridge
  1. A partial melt zone that is tapped to form the ocean crust close to the axis

## Transform Boundaries: Morphology / Distribution

<center>

![Transform](images/GlobalTectonics/feart-07-00039-g002.jpg) <!-- .element style="width:75%" -->

</center>

As we already saw, transform boundaries in the ocean are often found offsetting mid-ocean ridges and they
leave scars across the ocean floor that are no longer active as *plate boundaries*.

Map of the equatorial Mid-Atlantic Ridge, showing the Romanche and Chain transform faults and bathymetry.

The depth of seismic slip on oceanic transform faults is controlled by temperature and is limited by the ,600 8C isotherm. The focal mechanisms of earthquakes of the two transform faults show impressive consistency, indicating that the faults are highly planar.

## Partitioning of Plate Motions

![](images/GlobalTectonics/san-andreas-transform-plate-boundary-10x.jpg) <!-- .element style="width:40%;float:right; margin-left:50px;" -->

</center>

There are times when plate motion and the plate boundary orientation are not consistent with the simple picture we painted of the kinematics. This happens in the Gulf of California.

For example, here is what happens when a transform fault is subject to some extensional motion. 

It becomes a *"leaky transform"* which is actually a staircase structure of transform faults and short lengths of spreading.

This map is the plate motions derived from the NUVEL-1 model in a No-Net-Rotation frame of reference in which the major contienental masses do not move very much. 

The strain rate is similar to the global strain rate map but is saturated so that you can see the continental deformation patterns.

## Continental v. Oceanic Plate Boundaries

<center>

![](images/GlobalTectonics/HimalayaS.png) <!-- .element style="width:60%;" -->

</center>

This is a close-up of the strain rate in the Himalayas -- a collision zone which we can also think of as a convergent plate boundary that has been entirely congested by continental crust.

In continental regions, the processes that are responsible for creating the distinct types of plate boundaries in the oceans are masked because of the thick, buoyant crust that makes up a significant fraction of the lithosphere.
