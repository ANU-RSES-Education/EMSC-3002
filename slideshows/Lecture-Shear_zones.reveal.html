## Transition from brittle to ductile beahviour with increasing depth

Gradual Brittle-Ductile transition bfrom faults, which normally form in the upper crust, and ductile shear zones.

The depth of the transition depends on the **temperature gradient** and the **mineralogy** of the crust.
For a granitic crust it normally occurs in the range of 10-15km.

## Shear zones

Strain and Shear strain in particular tend to localise into zones or bands.
Shear zones are classic examples of strain localisation.

*A Shear zone is a tabular zone in which strain is notably higher than in the surrounding rock.*

Shear zones occur at almost any scale in any tectonic regime and form at any depth, almost most commonly in the plastic regime.
The definition of shear zone is not restricted to a specific scale.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Shear zones

Broad definition goes beyond **simple shear** deformation:

- pure shear zones
- subsimple shear zones
- simple shear zones

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Shear zones

Broad definition include **faults** and **ductile shear zones**.

**shear zones** have a thickness that is significant relative to their displacement.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Distribution of strain

**Ductile shear zones** show a gradual distribution of strain. They show evidence of both plastic and brittle deformation mechanisms
**Faults** or **non-ductile shear zones** are essentially formed by brittle deformation. Faults are a subclass of shear-zones.

Other subclasses can be defined based on the kinematics, mineral deformation mechanisms, metamorphic grade etc.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Kinematic classification

- compaction zones
- simple shear zones
- dilation zones

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Brittle versus plastic shear zones

Elements within a shear zone can deform plastically and brittely at the same time.

The deformation mechanism depends on temperature, pressure, strain rate, mineralogy, heterogeneities,
amount of fluid available etc. and can vary through space and time.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Brittle shear zones

Brittle deformation dominates: **cataclasic flow** which involves micro-fracturing, frictional sliding, rigid rotations.
We talk about **brittle** or **frictional shear zones**.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Plastic shear zones

Plastic deformation dominates

The transition between brittle and plastic deformation can be quite wide. We talk of **brittle-plastic shear zones** which
can include both plastic and brittle deformation.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Ductile shear zones

Ductility is different than plasticity in the sense that it relates to continuity of original markers.
**continuous deformation / strain**: marker layers can be traced through the zone at the mesoscopic scale.

Most plastic shear zone preserve continuity, some brittle shear zones too.
A **ductile shear zone** can deform britelly and plastically.

In most cases the deformation is **semi-ductile** as we often observe small sharp discontinuities.

Some shear zones show no continuity at all (heavily fractured zone, breccias).

## The ideal plastic shear zone

- Limited by 2 planar boundaries that separate the area deformed from the surrounding rocks.
- Perfectly ductile and involve **simple shear** with or without **compaction / dilation**
- Present a foliation, lineation and evidence of strain variation. 

Ideal plastic shear zones are found in more or less isotropic rocks.


</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## The ideal plastic shear zone

The **foliation** initiate at a 45 degrees angle to the shear plane, perpendicular to the fastest shortening direction of the strain ellipsoid.
It then rotates as the deformation increases and becomes parallel to the shear plane.

A **stretching lineation** can develop and can be used to determine the X-axis.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Simple shear zones

- Plane strain deformation with $$W_k = 1$$
- No shortening nor stretching along or normal to the zone
- ISA1 oriented at 45 degrees to the shear plane
- Strain ellipsoid X-axis initiate at 45 degrees to the walls and progressively rotates towards parralelism

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Mylonites

Highly strained rocks in the central part of some plastic shear zones.

Pre-existing structures and textures are totally flattened and transposed and are hard to identify.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Kinematic indicators

### Asymmetric structures

The (a)symmetry of mylonitic structures can be used to determine the sense of shear and the degree of coaxiality of the deformation.


</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Kinematic indicators
### Deflected markers

Rotation of planar marker from an area of low strain to an area of high strain provide very reliable criteria for sense of shear.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Kinematic indicators
### Mylonitic foliation and shear bands (S-C structures)

The foliation usually trace the XY-plane of the strain ellipsoid.

The foliation (S for shistosity) curves in and out of the C-surfaces (C for 'cisaillement', french for 'shear') and the sense
of deflection reflect the sense of shear of the shear-zone.

It is important to remember that C structures form relatively late and may only reflect the last stage of deformation.


</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Kinematic indicators
### Microscale foliation

Mineral aggregates are usually part of the foliation but the main axis of the deformed grain define an oblique foliation.

Result of 2 competing effects:

- strain produced by grain elongation
- dynamic recristallisation

The oblique foliation reflect the last increment of deformation while the foliation integrates the entire deformation history.

Any angle with the foliation indicates that the deformation is non coaxial and can help in determining the degree of non coaxiality.
It can also help to determine the sense of shear.

### Mica fish

Type of S-C structure

- Tails curve away from the genral orientation
- The asymmetry indicates the sense of shear

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Kinematic indicators
### Foliation fish and foliation boudinage

Parts of strongly foliated mylonite back-rotate with respect to the shear direction and create structures similar to mica-fish.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Kinematic indicators
### Boudinage

Rotated boudins can be used to determine the sense of shear.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Kinematic indicators
### Porphyroclastes

Recrystallised material around large mineral can form tails.

Asymmetry highlight non-coaxial deformation with the final shape being a function of Wk.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Kinematic indicators
### Folds and cleavage

Asymmetric folds and associated cleavages within the shear zone can give the sense of shear.

The mylonitic foliation is often folded.

Pre-existing structures (eg dikes)

### Quarter structures

Association of contraction and extension structures around tectonic lenses.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Kinematic indicators
### Crystallographic orientation

Mesure of C-axis orientation of quartz grains.

Asymmetry with respect to foliation gives sense of shear.

Require large densities of crystals. Common in porphyritic magmatic rocks.

## Kinematic indicators
### Fiber and veins

Orientation of extensional veins indicate the sense of shear.
Fibers are usually more reliable.
If the deformation is non-coaxial, the veins rotate and become sygmoide that can be used to determine the sense of shear.
