## Structural Geology and Crustal deformation

**What is it about?**

Structural geology covers deformation structures formed in the Earth's crust and in the underlying mantle in response to tectonic forces, in the cool upper part where the rocks have a tendency to fracture and in the hotter lower part where the deformation tends to be ductile.

Deformations structures can form almost instantaneously like during earthquakes or over millions of years like mountains.

## Structural Geology and Crustal deformation

**What are we interested in?**

- **Geometry** of structures; i.e. description of orientations and geometric relationships between structures.
- **Styles of Deformation**, including quantitative estimates of amount of deformation.
- **Processes of Deformation**, brittle versus ductile mechanisms.

## Structural Geology and Crustal deformation

Structural geology studies structures at the scale of hundreds of kilometers down to micro- or atomic scales.

- **Macroscopic**: regional, crustal scale observations.
- **Mesoscopic**: outcrop observations.
- **Microscopic**: hand specimen and smaller scale of observation.

## Structural Geology and Crustal deformation

**Pumpelly's Rule**:

*The geometry and style of small-scale structures usually reflect the geometry and styles of larger structures*

(Raphael Pumpelly, USGS, 1894)

## A wide range of methods to approach structural geology

- Field observations: final product of deformation.
- Laboratory experiments: useful to observe and understand progressive deformation.
- Numerical modeling: useful to quantify and understand the role and interactions of forces.

Each method has its own limitations but by combining them, the structural geologist is able to understand
the formation of structures and their meaning.

## Structures produced by deformation

**Where does deformation occur?**

Predominantly at, or near, plate boundaries in a range of tectonic contexts:

- convergent
- divergent
- oblique convergence / transform

But also in intraplate settings.

## Structures produced by deformation

**Large-scale structures associated with deformation induced changes to crustal thickness**

Mountain Belts: predominantly in context of crustal shortening.

## Structures produced by deformation

**Large-scale structures associated with deformation induced changes to crustal thickness**

Sedimentary basins: crustal stretching.

Structural Geology deals with structures created during rock deformation, not with primary structures
formed by sedimentary or magmatic processes.

However, being able to recognize tectonic deformation depends on our knowledge of primary structures...

Deformation structures depends on the material, its texture and structure.

Different materials, such as sandstones, limestones, granites respond differently to deformation and produce
different structures.
