# Introduction

This course is designed to develop an advanced understanding of deformation processes and structures produced by displacement and deformation in the Earth's lithosphere at scales ranging from the tectonic plate scale, down to the crystal lattice scale. Emphasis is placed on understanding (1) the geometry and types of structures produced by complex crustal deformation histories involving contractional, extensional and wrench regimes, (2) the deformation processes which control the microstructural evolution of deformed rocks, (3) factors influencing the strength and mechanical behaviour of the Earth's crust and underlying mantle lithosphere, (4) deformational controls on crustal-scale fluid flow and applications to understanding ore genesis and earthquake processes, and (5) the large-scale geodynamic processes controlling plate motions and crustal deformation.

## What you will learn from this course

Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:
  - Recognise, map and interpret the geological structure of deformed continental regimes, from mildly deformed upper crustal regimes to complexly deformed, deeper crustal regimes.

  - Interpret the relative timing of formation of structures, the kinematics of deformation, and progressive deformation histories.
  - Predict the geometry and location of structures at depth or in areas of poor outcrop.
  - Apply an understanding of structural geology in the mining and resource exploration environment.
