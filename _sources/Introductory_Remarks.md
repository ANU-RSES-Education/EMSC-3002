# Introduction

This course is designed to develop an advanced understanding of deformation processes and structures produced by displacement and deformation in the Earth's lithosphere at scales ranging from the tectonic plate scale, down to the crystal lattice scale. Emphasis is placed on understanding (1) the geometry and types of structures produced by complex crustal deformation histories involving contractional, extensional and wrench regimes, (2) the deformation processes which control the microstructural evolution of deformed rocks, (3) factors influencing the strength and mechanical behaviour of the Earth's crust and underlying mantle lithosphere, (4) deformational controls on crustal-scale fluid flow and applications to understanding ore genesis and earthquake processes, and (5) the large-scale geodynamic processes controlling plate motions and crustal deformation.

## What you will learn from this course

Upon successful completion, students will have the knowledge and skills to:

  - Recognise, map and interpret the geological structure of deformed continental regimes, from mildly deformed upper crustal regimes to complexly deformed, deeper crustal regimes.
  - Interpret the relative timing of formation of structures, the kinematics of deformation, and progressive deformation histories.
  - Predict the geometry and location of structures at depth or in areas of poor outcrop.
  - Apply an understanding of structural geology in sustainable mining and basin management.

## Course Themes

The broad themes of the course and these materials can be broken down as follows

### Lecture 1 - Introduction and expectations

  - [Introduction](Lectures/Lecture-1-Introduction)

### Module i - Global Tectonics 

  - [Global Tectonics](Lectures/Module-i-GlobalTectonics)

Introduces the concepts of global-scale tectonics, plate motions, the nature of plate boundaries and the geological structures characteristic of large-scale deformation of the crust.

### Module ii - Structures in the Earth

  - [Structures](Lectures/Module-ii-Structural-Geology-And-Crustal-Deformation)


This module aims to develop student intuition and proficiency in 3- and 4-dimensional visualization and thinking and teach the fundamentals of rock deformation using natural examples.

You will be given an overview of the geometry and type of structures produced by complex crustal deformation histories involving contractional, extensional and wrench regimes over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. You will learn how to recognise structural features using satellite imagery, geological maps and will learn how to construct geological profiles.

### Module iii - Theoretical Underpinnings

In order to understand geological structures in more detail, we need some background understanding of how stresses and strains work, how they are measured, and how you can use these concepts to interpret what you see in the field. 

### Module iv - Brittle Deformation

 - [Brittle Deformation](Lectures/Module-iv-BrittleDeformation)

When rocks undergo rapid, localised deformation, refer to the process as "brittle deformation". Typically brittle features in the Earth's crust are faults and we can understand much about the stress and deformation if we understand faults, their rupture and associated seismic energy release. 

### Module v - Ductile Deformation

Ductile deformation occurs when rocks are able to accommodate large deformations without fracturing.  You will learn how to recognise elements of ductile deformation such as folding, shearing and stretching.

We will see how folds represent important windows into local and regional deformation histories. You will learn how to describe geometry and different styles of folding and will understand how we can use them to derive important information about the type of deformation. You will then learn about structures associated with folding and see how they can be used to map and understand the deformation history.

We will first look at the geometric aspects of folds then will pay attention to the mechanisms at work during folding of rock layers. 

We will then look at the relationships with other structural features such as cleavages, lineations, shistosities, boudinages and how we can retrieve kinematic and paleostress information from them. 

We will look at the formation of shear zones and will learn how to recognise important kinematic indicators.
